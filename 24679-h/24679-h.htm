<div class="blockquote"><p>That Eve was Adam&#8217;s second wife was a common Rabbinic speculation. Certain
commentators on Genesis adopted this view, to account for the double
account of the creation of woman, in the sacred text, first in Genesis i. 27, and
second in Genesis xi. 18. And they say that Adam&#8217;s first wife was named Lilith,
but she was expelled from Eden, and after her expulsion Eve was created. Abraham
Ecchelensis gives the following account of Lilith and her doings: &#8220;There
are some who do not regard spectres as simple devils, but suppose them to be of
a mixed nature&mdash;part demoniacal, part human, and to have had their origin from
Lilith, Adam&#8217;s first wife, by Eblis, prince of the devils. This fable has been
transmitted to the Arabs, from Jewish sources, by some converts of Mohamet
from Cabbalism and Rabbinism, who have transferred all the Jewish fooleries to
the Arabs. They gave to Adam a wife formed of clay, along with Adam, and
called her Lilith, resting on the Scripture: &#8216;Male and female created He them.&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;<i>Legends
of the Patriarchs and Prophets.&mdash;Baring Gould.</i></p>

<p>Lilith or Lilis.&mdash;In the popular belief of the Hebrews, a female spectre in the
shape of a finely dressed woman, who lies in wait for, and kills children. The old
Rabbins turned Lilith into a wife of Adam, on whom he begat demons and who
still has power to lie with men and kill children who are not protected by amulets
with which the Jews of a yet later period supply themselves as a protection against
her. Burton in his <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> tells us: &#8220;The Talmudists say that
Adam had a wife called Lilis, before he married Eve, and of her he begat nothing
but devils.&#8221; A commentator on Skinner, quoted in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Metropolitana</i>,
says that the English word <i>Lullaby</i> is derived from Lilla, abi (begone,
Lilith)! In the demonology of the Middle Ages, Lilis was a famous witch, and
is introduced as such in the Walpurgis night scene in Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Faust.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Webster&#8217;s
Dictionary.</i></p>

<p>Our word <i>Lullaby</i> is derived from two Arabic words which mean &#8220;Beware of
Lilith!&#8221;&mdash;<i>Anon.</i></p>

<p>Lilith, the supposed wife of Adam, after she married Eblis, is said to have ruled
over the city of Damascus.&mdash;<i>Legends of the Patriarchs and Prophets.&mdash;Baring
Gould.</i></p></div>

<p>From these few and meagre details of a fabled existence,
which are all that the author has been able to collect from
any source whatever, has sprung the following poem. The
poet feels quite justified in dissenting from the statements
made in the preceding extracts, and has not drawn Lilith as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>there represented&mdash;the bloodthirsty sovereign who ruled
Damascus, the betrayer of men, the murderer of children.
The Lilith of the poem is transferred to the more beautiful
shadow-world. To that country which is the abode of poets
themselves. And about her is wrapt the humanizing element
still, and everywhere embodied in the sweetest word the
human tongue can utter&mdash;<i>lullaby</i>. Some critics declare that
true literary art inculcates a lofty lesson&mdash;has a high moral
purpose. If poets and their work must fall under this rigorous
rule, then alas &#8220;Lilith&#8221; will knock at the door of
public opinion with a trembling hand indeed. If the poem
have either moral aim or lesson of any kind (which observe,
gentle critic, it is by no means asserted that it has), it is
simply to show that the strongest intellectual powers contain
no elements adverse to the highest and purest exercise of
the affectional nature. That, in its true condition, the noblest,
the most cultured intellect, and the loveliest, sublimest moral
and emotional qualities, together weave the web that clothes
the world&#8217;s great soul with imperishable beauty. The possessor
of highest intellectual capacity will be also capable of
highest developments in the latter qualities. The woman of
true intellect is the woman of truest affection. For the rest
let Lilith speak, whose life dropped unrecorded from the
earliest world. It is the poet&#8217;s hope that the chords of the
mother-heart universal will respond to the song of the
childless one. That in the survival of that one word <i>lullaby</i>,
may be revivified the pathetic figure of one whose home,
whose hope, whose Eden passed to another. Whose name
living in the terrors of superstitious peoples, now lingers in
Earth&#8217;s sweetest utterance. That Pagan Lilith, re-baptized
in the pure waters of maternal love, shall breathe to heathen
and Christian motherhood alike, that most sacred love of
Earth still throbbing through its tender lullaby.</p>

<span class="i1">Only thin, scattered blades from harvests gleaned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erewhile I plucked, may happen thee to please.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So poor indeed, those others had demeaned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves to cull; or from their strong, firm hands<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Down dropped about their feet with careless laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too broken for home gathering, these strands,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">The pillows with the print of her wee head.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, mother-heart, this song, where through still rings<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The strain you sang above my baby bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bring. An idle gift mayhap, that clings<br /></span>
<span class="i1">About old days forgotten long, and dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This loitering tale, Valeria, take.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Perchance &#8217;tis sad, and hath not any mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet love thou it, for the weak singer&#8217;s sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And hold it dear, though yet is little worth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In that fair land, all hues, all leafage green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt flawless days in endless summer-sheen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright eyes, the violet waking, lifted up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where bent the lily her deep, fragrant cup;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folded buds, &#8217;gainst many a leafy spray&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild-woods&#8217; voiceless nuns&mdash;knelt down to pray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There roses, deep in greenest mosses swathed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept happy tryst with tropic blooms, sun-bathed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sounds of sadness surged through listening trees:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><span class="i0">The waters babbled low; the errant bees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made answer, murmurous; nor paled the hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jonquils wore; nor chill the wild breath grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of daisies clustered white in dewy croft;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fell the tasseled plumes as satin soft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the broad-leaved corn. Sweet all the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#8217;erflowed with music every woodland way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet the jargonings of nested bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When light the listless wind the forest stirred.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Straight as the shaft that &#8217;gainst the morning sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slender palm uprears, the Fairest one&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first of womankind&mdash;sweet Lilith&mdash;stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gracious shape that glorified the wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her rounded shoulders warm and bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like netted sunshine fell her lustrous hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rosy flush of young pomegranate bells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dawned on her cheeks; and blue as in lone dells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep the Forget-me-nots, her eyes. With bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brows, sullen-creased, swart Adam gazed intent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a leopard, crouched low in its place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his feet. Not once in Lilith&#8217;s face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked, nor sought her wistful, downcast eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shifting shadows dusk, and strange surprise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;O, Love,&#8221; she said, &#8220;no more let us contend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweet is life, anger, methinks, should end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this, our garden bright, why dost thou claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever the highest place, the noblest name?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freely to both our Lord gave self-same sway<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><span class="i0">O&#8217;er living things. Love, thou art gone astray!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twin-born, of equal stature, kindred soul<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their course above, down-looking on my face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See yours as fair; in neither aught that&#8217;s base.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy wife, not handmaid I, yet thou dost say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;I first in Eden rule.&#8217; Thou, then, hast sway.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Run at thy bidding, crouch beside thy knee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift up (when thou dost bid me) timid eyes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so will Lilith dwell in Paradise.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Mine own,&#8221; Adam made answer soft, &#8220;&#8217;twere best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou didst forget such ills in noontide rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content I wake, the keeper of the place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of equal stature? Yea! Of self-same grace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, Love; recall those lately vanished eves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we together plucked the plantain leaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon leopard lowly stretched at my command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its lazy length beneath my soothing hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At thee she snarled, disdaining half, to sheathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Neath thy soft pleading eyes her milk-white teeth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft, Love, in other times, in sheltered nook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We scattered pearly millet by the brook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo thine lay barren in the sand. Quick mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upspringing sifts o&#8217;er pale blooms odors fine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hateful thy chidings grow; each breeze doth bring<br /></span>

<span class="i0">These many days I weary of thy sighs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know, Lilith, I alone rule Paradise.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat he rose, and quick at every stride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fawning leopard gambolled at his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So fell the first dark shadow of Earth&#8217;s strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With coming evil all the winds were rife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lone lay the land with sense of dull loss paled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The days grew sick at heart; the sunshine failed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And falling waters breathed in silvery moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hidden ail to starlit dells alone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sometimes you have seen, &#8217;neath household eaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Mong scents of Springtime, in the budded leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swallows circling blithe, with slant brown wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home-flying fleet, with tender chattering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the place o&#8217;errun with nested love&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So have you come, when leaves hung crisp above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silent door. Yet not again, I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those shining wings, cleaving the air, have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor heard the gladsome swallows twittering there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the empty nests, low-hung and bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake of the scattered brood.&mdash;So lonely were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Lilith grown her once loved haunts. Nor fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The starlit nights, slow-dropping fragrant dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the dim groves when dawn came shifting through.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far &#8217;mong the hills the wood-doves&#8217; moan she heard,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span><span class="i0">Or in some nearer copse, a startled bird;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the white moonshine &#8217;mong green boughs o&#8217;erhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought her full heart to tears. &#8220;Sweet peace,&#8221; she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Alas&mdash;lies slain!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">With musing worn, she brake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last her silence, and to Adam spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Beyond these walls I know not what may be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Islands low-fringed, or bare; or tranquil sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spaces unpeopled, wastes of burning sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green-wooded belts, enclasping summer lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or realms of dusky pines, or wolds of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or jagged ice-peaks wrapt in purple glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or shadowy oceans lapped in fadeless sheen&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet there were Paradise, were Lilith queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dally with my lord I was not meant;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To soothe his idle whims, above him bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm in my milk-white arms, lull his repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor deep in subtle kisses drown his woes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, since here no more dwells love, I fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek my home in other lands. For why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should Lilith wait since Adam&#8217;s empty state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More dear he holds than Lilith desolate?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But answer soft made Adam at the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For faint his dying love, yet coldly stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its ashen cerements: &#8220;Nay, love, our home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within these garden walls lies safe. Wouldst roam<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><span class="i0">Without? Sweet peace, by loss, wilt thou restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One little loss, or miss it evermore?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;In goodly Eden, Adam, safely bide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I, for peace, nor love, nor life,&#8221; she cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Submit to thee. Unto our Lord I own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allegiance true; my homage his alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft have I watched the mists athwart yon peaks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursuing oft past coves and winding creeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have thought to touch their shining veil outspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In happy days ere Love, alas, was dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So now, farewell! Ere the new day shall break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown their gleaming track, my way I take.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turned; but ere the gate that looked without<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She reached, one fleeting moment paused in doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a river&#8217;s brink. In one swift glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All coming time she saw. A weird romance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein she traced great peoples yet unborn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New springing cycles, strange lands cleft with tarn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or pleasant vale, and green plains stretching far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quiet bays, and many a shingly bar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And troubled seas, with bitter perils past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And elfin shapes that jeering flitted fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scornful faces, leering lips that smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or bursts of laughter through that vision wild.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncertain, then, she stood, half loth to turn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Against yon deepening sky, how dimly burn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars, new-lit. Dear home, thou art so fair!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She fondly sighed.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span><span class="i8">Then sudden she was &#8217;ware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The angel near her paused, whose watchful care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guards Eden&#8217;s peaceful bounds. Serene, his air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tender-sweet, so pure the gentle face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She scarce dared look upon its subtle grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad were his eyes; his words, rebuking, fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft as the moonshine clear, in sleeping dell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;My sister, go not hence, lest these gates bar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilith forever out. From peace afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anger and pride shall lead through distant ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy feet reluctant, in the evil days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is decreed. At yonder southern gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold! waits even now my princely mate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou can&#8217;st not tell which hath in our far land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The highest place. Nay; nor, indeed, whose hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath grasped the noblest fame; nor yet divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose brows enwound with honor, brightest shine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pleasant labor lurks no thought of pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greatest loss oft brings the noblest gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart&#8217;s warm pulse feels not one throb of strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Love is holiest crown of human life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere thou didst sleep, beyond the rim of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a voice that sang. The carol light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce earth-born seemed.  So sweet the matchless strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its cadence weird, lowly to breathe again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt echo, listening, half forgot; and o&#8217;er<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span><span class="i0">And o&#8217;er, as joyous birds unprisoned soar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The free notes rose. And in the silence wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the seas, across the night, I cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O sinless soul, whose clear voice blithely rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Gainst the blue verge of stars! &#8217;Tis Lilith sings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy song of love. O Love! the tint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of light divine thou wearest. Thou hast no hint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of storm or turmoil, or of Sin&#8217;s rough ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose feet to heaven climb, through darkest maze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, Lilith, sure the love that basely weighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stoops to count its gifts, and hoarding, says,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;Such and so many, these indeed are mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hold my treasure dear, nor covet thine;&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is not love; &#8217;tis Thrift in borrowed dress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deceiving thee. Love giveth free largess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With open hand, clean as the whitest day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, that it gave, forgetteth it straightway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond these walls dwells bliss that lives not here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou hast bartered peace, outshining clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And storm-tossed wide, art wildly driven hence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The outer world gives thee no recompense.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each shining sphere that trembles in blue space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath orbit true&mdash;its own familiar place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor doth the planet pale that gems the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reel wanton down, the smallest star to smite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No twining vine, tendril, or springing shoot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere taught thee so; for bud and leaf and root<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth its best self lift upward into light,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet climbing still, scorns not the sacred right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shrines its fellow.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">&#8220;So pattering rains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark roots drink&mdash;and healthful juice slow drains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep &#8217;neath the mould; and with their secret toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear stainless, leaf and flow&#8217;r above the soil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noblest the soul that self hath most forgot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strongest the self which hath most humbly wrought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purest the soul that in full light serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unquestioning, enwrapt, God&#8217;s field doth glean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have seen worlds far hence; thy tender feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleeding, will tread their stony ways. And sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is love. And wedded love, grown cold and rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More bitter-seeming makes dull solitude.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Security is sweet; and light and warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young heart beats, close shut from every harm.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Yet,&#8221; Lilith answered slow, &#8220;in that still night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere He, the garden&#8217;s Lord, passed from our sight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A solitary reign? Hath she in aught<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The compact. Therefore, unhindered let me take<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Far, far away,&#8221; she sighed.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">&#8220;Yet ere these bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy feet pass, linger. Lilith, list glad sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That greet thine ear. Slow cycles will pass on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the time-to-be-bright years, grow wan;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy fruit of life lift bloom all sere and pale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Certain, small comfort bides, when joy is gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Great or Less. Grim Sorrow waits to lead thee on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow! Thou hast not seen her pallid face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thy most troubled dream she had no place&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nay, I depart,&#8221; she said, with lips grown chill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Fearless and free, exiled, but princess still.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;I may not hinder thee,&#8221; the Angel sighed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;No soul unwilling here may ever bide.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow swung the verdant gates neath saddest eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lilith forever lost fair Paradise.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The walls of Paradise, through night&#8217;s dark rift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilith fled far; nor stopped lest deadly snare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or peril by the wayside lurked.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">The air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew chill. Loud beat her heart, as through the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed, unseen, pursuing feet, behind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Adown the pathway of the mist she passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reached a weird, strange land at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When morning flecked the dappled sky with red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And odors sweet from waking flowers were shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilith beheld a plain, outstretching wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With distant mountains seamed.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Afar, a silvery tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue shore kissed.  And in that tropic glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim islands shone, palm-fringed, and low.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In nearer space, like scarlet arrows flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange birds, or &#8217;mong the reedy fens, or through<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><span class="i0">Tall trees, of unknown leafage, glancing, went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Lilith seaward passed, and stooping, bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hollowed hand above the wave, and quaffed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she was spent with wanderings wide.  Loud laughed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She then, beholding on that silent shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rare shells, that still faint in their pink lips bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild ocean-songs; and precious stones, that bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dim sea&#8217;s marge, deep in the land of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick strewed.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Then glad, she lifted shining eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud crying there, &#8220;O Lilith, now arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great queen-triumphant! See how wildly fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before me lies my realm! And from its air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft, sensuous, new life as ruddy wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit drinks. Nor beauty so divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath Eden&#8217;s self. Look, where upon the sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The garish mosses spread with dainty hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like goblin network fine, each fairy frond.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dusky trees shut in broad fields beyond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hang long trembling garlands, age-grown-gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From topmost boughs adown, athwart the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet amid these wilds, bright dewy bells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ring summer chimes.  And soft in fragrant dells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Mong tender leaves, great spikes of scarlet flaunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the pools&mdash;the errant wild bees&#8217; haunt&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thick with bramble-blooms pink petals starred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dew-stained buds of blue, the velvet sward.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><span class="i0">Scarce ripple stirred the sea; and inland wend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far bays and sedgy ponds; and rolling rivers bend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A land of leaf and fruitage in the glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of palest glamours steeped. And far and low<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But perils past, fade fast. And I will weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Eden lost no more.&#8221; And sweet and low<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With golden bands, from bent boughs, stripped she. Through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gleaming sphere its nectrous juices drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thirsting cried&mdash;as one grown drunken: &#8220;Mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These fruits unknown, in thorny combs that shine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Out-flinging fruity breath upon the wind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My wilful spouse such nectars fine. Nor gains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His patient care the fruitage rare, these plains<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In lotus blooms, or, &#8217;mong the storm-clouds whirled;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Soft emerald, sapphire pale, and many a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out-gleaming amethyst. Her yellow hair<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And on the sands piled turtle eggs, when all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About hoarse-shrieked the water-fowl, or call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of plovers fell among the tangled glens,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where poised gemmed dragon-flies;  and sudden moans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook &#8217;mong blue flags. Waked, vague unrest<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And longing love, that she ne&#8217;er more might still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When late upon her parting day smiled chill,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sea o&#8217;erlooking. Far the horizon&#8217;s edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart her gaze a rim of blue hills cleft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat she sighed. &#8220;So rose, ere I them left,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where soft about it memories sweet may blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As summer winds the fallen leaves among.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then passed her tender thoughts, and loud and glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As our morn wakens, strong that yesternight slept sad,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unsorrowed by soft dreams or thoughts of eld&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ide</span> through her realm she walked, and glad or lorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She mused. So, loitering, it chanced one morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lone she sat upon a mountain height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sudden stood anear, whose dark eyes bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her shone. Pallid his face, and red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His smileless lips. &#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; Lilith said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faint a hidden pain her hot heart stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When low, and rarely sweet, his voice she heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looked, half-pleased&mdash;and half in strange surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrank &#8217;neath the gaze of those wild, starry eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, dame,&#8221; the stranger said, &#8220;where waters leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright glancing down, I rested oft, where steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Eden o&#8217;er, bare-browed, a peak uprose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naught craving bloom or fruitage&mdash;nay, nor those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frail joys Adam holds dear. One only boon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought of all his heritage. Fair &#8217;neath the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw thee stand; and all about thy feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night her perfume spilled, soft incense meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then low I sighed, when grew thy beauty on my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;Some comfort yet remains, if that I might<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span><span class="i0">From Adam pluck this perfect flower. Some morn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I (some dreamed-of morn, perchance slow-born)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This flawless bloom, white, fragrant, lustrous, pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever on my breast might hold secure.&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, for thy love, through darkling realms of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I followed thee, sharing thy fearful flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen. Lo, when thy timid heart, behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard echoing phantom feet upon the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Twas I, pursuing o&#8217;er the day&#8217;s last brink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, I now am here. O Lilith, think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How over-much I love thee, and how sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were life with thee! O weary naked feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me each onward path wilt thou not tread?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if thou endest here thy quest,&#8221; he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Let me too bide with thee.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Made answer low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilith thereto: &#8220;Meseems not long ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One stood at Eden&#8217;s gate like thee. But thy face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is darker, red thy lips. Of kingly race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know thee. Say, whence comest thou, O prince?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nay, then,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;an outcast I, long since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Heaven thrust out; yet now, the curse is past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor mourn I Heaven lost, if at the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy love I win. Yea, where thou art, I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Heaven. And bliss, in sooth&#8221; (oh, soft and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said), &#8220;lives ever in thy smile.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span><span class="i13">His speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus ended. And toward the sandy beach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed. Though long her eyes the stranger sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where curved the distant shore, she saw him not.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soft through the trees the mottled shadows dropped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Lilith in her pleasance sat. Half-propped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Gainst mossy trunk her slender length. Her hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sunny web, enmeshed her elbows bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly the breeze swayed the mimosas slight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Eblis pushed aside the bent boughs light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;O dame,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it seemeth surely meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth&#8217;s richest gifts to lay at Lilith&#8217;s feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore I said &#8216;unto the fairest one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things loveliest beneath the shining sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bring.&#8217; Since of all crafts in this young earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am true master, unto her whose worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much deserves, I bear this marble sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hollowed husk, well polished, gleaming clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hides rarest fruit.&#8221; Therewith the globe he showed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The half whereof smooth-sparkling was: Half glowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With carven work; embossed with pale leaves light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And delicately sculptured birds in flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clustered flowers frail. Lilith drew near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With beaming eyes, and laid the graven sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against her smiling lips; o&#8217;ertraced the vine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That circled it with fingers slim. &#8220;Mine, mine<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span><span class="i0">Is it, O prince?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I know not why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its beauty doth recall the winds&#8217; long sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That surged among the palms.  Methinks is dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some summer-tide, that in its own sweet stead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath left upon the stone its imaging.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eblis replied: &#8220;On earth, is anything<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More fair? If such thou knowest, Lilith, speak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I, for thee, surely would straightway seek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, if indeed thou findest anywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On land or sea, created things so rare?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lilith answered, &#8220;On this earth so round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naught else so lovely anywhere I found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shames it meaner work&mdash;so had I said&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But see yon nodding palm that droops its head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low sighing o&#8217;er the wave. Bring me a bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So feathery-fine. Turn thy white sphere! Now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On its cold, fair surface, Eblis, canst thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such branches carve, or tender fronds, that we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright waving on the cocoa, these may see?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Eblis wrought till grew upon the stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such airy boughs as on the cocoa shone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Lilith cried: &#8220;Skilled craftsman, proven thou!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst thou, then, make my cocoa-tree? Thy bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale graven give the grace of its green crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When through it night winds gently slip adown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No charm of color, nor of change, nor glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blue noon sky, thy carven work doth show;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span><span class="i0">Let dusk bees visit it&mdash;or sip the breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thy chill marble buds.&#8221; Then, Lilith saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Eblis hath wroughten noblest on this earth.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He answered quick, &#8220;Poor bauble, little worth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The miracle thy rough rind doth conceal!&#8221;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">He touched a hidden spring, and wide apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The riven sphere showed its white hollow heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the midst a gem; the which he laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her hand. &#8220;Behold,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most fair for thee this lustrous blood-red sard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deftly traced its gleaming surface hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With carvings thick of bright acacias slim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pomegranates lush and river-reeds. Its rim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spray of leaves enchased, white as with rime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night fallen. &#8216;Slow drags the lagging time,&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said, &#8216;till one day shines upon the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her, whose perfect beauty worthiest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It decks, this gem.&#8217; The token, Lilith, take;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If lovelier there be, for Eblis&#8217; sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep silent; yet with me, oh Lilith, go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awhile from thine own land. Then shall I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gem finds favor in thine eyes.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Then she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned from her pleasance and all silently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed to the sea, across the yellow strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, glimmering, ringed her shadowy land.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span><span class="i0">&#8220;Oh cool,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the lucent waves that fret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The barren shore, and curl their scattered spray wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Gainst thy hand. Come! my longing pinnace waits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear thee far. Her slender keel now grates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the beach; and swift her shapely prow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will skim the deep, as swallows&#8217; fleet wing. Thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seest! comely and strong it is. For thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its golden sails, its purple canopy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With skin of spotted pard, I cushioned it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the fresh breeze doth die, light let us flit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the sea. No craft so proud, so staunch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes glancing through the foam.  I safely launch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her now, and speed to fairy isles. Come thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me.&#8221;  And glad she crossed the burnished prow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &#8217;mong the thick furred rugs sat down. &#8220;Oh craft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair fashioned, lightly built, speed far,&#8221; she laughed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;To other lands bear Lilith safe.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i13">As sailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They idly on, her slender hand she trailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the waves, and sudden cried, &#8220;Indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A craft stauncher than thine floats by. What need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath it of helm, or prow, or silken sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure harbor finding when the ocean gale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast drives it onward?&#8221; A nut she drew, round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rough, coarse-husked, forth from the wave. &#8220;Lo, I found,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><span class="i0">She said, &#8220;this boat well built. The cocoa-tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast it amid the foam. Its pilot free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summer wind; its port, the misty shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ocean isles. It fades from sight. &#8216;No more,&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We say, &#8216;it sails the wild uncertain main,&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the drifting days are gone, again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We turn our prow, and reach the barren isles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, stranded as we went, the nut. Now smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above; a bending tree. Aloud we cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;A miracle is wrought!&#8217; We draw anigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, the cocoa, towering, doth spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the brown nut&#8217;s heart. About it cling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet odors faint; and far stars trembling peep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When through its bowers cool the breezes creep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong, indeed, thy boat, well builded! I wis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There be yet other craft as firm, Eblis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That o&#8217;er these trackless waters boldly glide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave Nautilus afar, doth fearless ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sails of gossamer. So, too, doth spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To summer airs, his silken gleaming thread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water-spider fleet, free sailor true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the sunshine floats, beneath the blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad skies. And through the deep, all sparkling, slip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand insect-swarms, that, rippling, dip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the merry waves. Bright voyagers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That roam the sultry seas! Look, the wind stirs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our creaking sails! Thy pinnace flying o&#8217;er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ocean&#8217;s swell, fast leaves the fading shore;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet faster still the Nautilus sails by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And darts the spider quick. And swifter fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The insect-fleets among the foam; yet think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not when among the billows wild doth sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy bounding boat, I fear. Nor would I slight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy skill, that made it strong, and swift, and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trimmed it gayly, for my sake.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Now near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A jutting shore Prince Eblis drew, where sheer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brown rocks rose. And just beyond, a slim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beach of white sand curved to the ocean&#8217;s brim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereto he came, and high upon the strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew the boat&#8217;s keel. &#8220;Welcome, fair queen, to land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Eblis rules,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I fain would show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee what thou hast not seen in the warm glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy glad home. This blighted shore of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No verdure hath, nor bloom, nor fruits that shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Mong drooping boughs.  Far inland gloom lone peaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#8217;er blackened meads; or from their bare cones leaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaunt, crackling flame; or crawl like ashen veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smouldering fires across the stricken plains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in these yawning caves black shadows lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shall be lifted never more. Come, I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enter! Know thou what treasure by the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gathered other time.&#8221; Therewith showed he<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span><span class="i0">Hid &#8217;mong the high heaped rocks a dusky grot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where never sunshine fell. A dismal spot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dank the sea-weeds coiled and cold the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept through. And stooping, Eblis downward rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before her webs of woven stuff, in fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of purple sheen, enwrought with flecks of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great wefts of scarlet and of blue, thick strewn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pearls, or cleft with discs of jacinth stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drifts of silky woof and samite white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warps of Orient hues. Eblis light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wound round her neck a scarf of amber. Wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its smooth folds sweeping flowed; and proud he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Among these hills, in the still loom of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wrought for Lilith&#8217;s pleasing, all. And bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have spun these webs, in blended morning hues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And noontide shades and trail of silver dews&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hereon have set fair traceries of cloud-shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tints of the far vales. The textures fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glow with sweet thoughts of thee. And otherwhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou such fabrics seen, or colors rare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As these?&#8221; Dawned in her eyes a swift delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And low she cried, &#8220;Oh, wondrous is the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much it pleaseth me. But yet,&#8221; she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Beside my knee one morn, its hooded head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Hag&egrave; reared. Its gliding shape so near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To subtler music moved, than my dull ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could catch. Its velvet skin I gently strake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the light that o&#8217;er its heaped coils brake<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><span class="i0">In glittering waves. Within its small, wise glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flame silent slept, or quick in baleful dance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before my startled gaze quivering did wake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair is thy woof, soft woven, yet the snake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out-dazzles it. The beetle that doth boom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its dull life out among the tangled gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift his wide wing above thy weft, or trail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His splendor there, and thy poor web will pale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, the red wayside lily that doth snare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The girdled bee, is softer still, more fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than finest woven cloth.&#8221; But tenderly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She smoothed the gleaming folds. &#8220;Much pleaseth me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Natlhess,&#8221; she said, &#8220;such loveliness.&#8221; Then brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tapestries of fleeces fine, well wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In colors soft as woodland mosses&#8217; tinge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or glow of autumn blooms: Heavy with fringe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of downward sweeping gold; arras, where through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed mottled stripes, or arabesques of blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broad zones of red, and tender grays, and hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dropping leaves. &#8220;Lilith,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm-tossed billows round these caves, behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spun these daintily. &#8217;Twere hard to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such twisted weft or woven strand.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, kind,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, &#8220;is Eblis, unto whom I fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would give due thanks. His gorgeous train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yesterday I saw the peacock spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright in the sun gleamed his small crested head;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><span class="i0">His haughty neck wrinkled to green and blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since I needs must truly speak, I knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not color rich as his: and I have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curious nest among the branches green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The busy weaver-bird plaits of thick leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in and out its pliant meshes weaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since thou sayest &#8217;twere hard to match thy fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong, woven fabrics, watch the weaver twine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cunning wefts. Though still,&#8221; she said, &#8220;think not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scorn thy gifts, Prince Eblis; for I wot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their worth is greater than my tongue can say.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then Eblis deeper in the cave led her a little way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed a stately screen of such fine art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One almost felt the breeze that seemed to part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pictured boughs. And o&#8217;er the stirless lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreamed the swift, wimpling waters sudden brake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the willows on its brink&mdash;and flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of scarlet, shining-clean from summer showers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Eblis said, &#8220;Cold praise a friend should spare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This picture true. Certain naught else will dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vie with such beauty.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Archly Lilith took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rose from her bright hair, and lightly shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dewdrop from its heart. &#8220;I loving, touch,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, &#8220;these petals smooth. O, Eblis, such<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span><span class="i0">Give to thy painted blooms; give its cool sheen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of morningtide, the mossy, lush leaves green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fold it round. Give its faint, fragrant breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with the fickle breeze it dallieth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, fairer still my rose than gilded screen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though it be limned with perfect art, I ween.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat smiled Eblis bitterly. &#8220;I bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One parting gift,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a dainty thing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance in other time it will recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One who strove long and patiently through all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These days to win thy praise.&#8221; An oval plane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of crystal gave he her; of fleck or stain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear-gleaming. Of ivory carven fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frame. And when she looked, &#8220;Divine,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laughed, &#8220;the beauty it enshrines. Canst claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aught else is fairer?&#8221; And Lilith again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed in the glass, her face beholding there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pink flushed cheeks, her yellow streaming hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick came her breath. &#8220;O prince,&#8221; she slowly said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Fair is the stranger. Bid those lips so red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak once to Lilith. For methinks the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such in music flowed. Let me rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therein.&#8221; &#8220;O glorious counterfeit!&#8221; cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He. &#8220;Lovelier is not on this earth wide!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, sweet Lilith, &#8217;tis thine own pure face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lends my happy mirror perfect grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It else had not. Bid thou thine image speak!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other happiness I elsewhere seek,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span><span class="i0">If the soft tale she whispers be of me.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lilith answered gravely, &#8220;I know thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eblis. Master indeed of all crafts thou&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red Sard, and marble sphere, and agile prow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pinnace light well wroughten were by thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And decked full fair. And, beauteous to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fine woven weft and web, and the tall screen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#8217;errun with painted bloom, crystal, with gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lilith&#8217;s face&mdash;thou madest these. Mayhap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beetle and asp likewise didst tint&mdash;didst wrap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green about my rose, and richly fringe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My cocoa-tree, or peacock&#8217;s train didst tinge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dazzling hues. Methought thou wert a prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now Lilith should humbly kneel, since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art far higher than she deemed, if thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Madest these wondrous things.&#8221; And lowly now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she would kneel, she drew anigh. But he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried, shrinking, &#8220;Nay, I made them not.&#8221; And she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low questioned, &#8220;Eblis, tell me who then, did make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them all. Who set the creeping hooded snake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stealthy pard within the thorny brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spread the sea, and wreathed the waterfall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With foam? Who reared the hoar hills, towering tall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the lands?&#8221; With eyes wild flashing, low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He groaned: &#8220;O Lilith, ask me not. My foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was&mdash;he is. Trembles with wrath my frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I but faintly breathe his awful name.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span><span class="i0">Lilith replied, &#8220;Meseemeth, master true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every craft is He.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Forth the two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that drear cavern passed. Ere the water&#8217;s brim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gained, he plucked the wilding reeds, that slim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood by a brook. &#8220;My pipe I make, one strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harmonious to wake. Nor yet again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt thou such fresh notes hear. Music like mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks thou hast not known in any time.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laid his pipe unto his lips, and blew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blast, wild, piercing, sweet. The far hills through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rung. And softer fell, yet wild and clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It ceased. With drooping eyes, &#8220;Once I did hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A song as wildly clear, as sad,&#8221; she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;In mine own realm.&#8221; And as she spoke, dark dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky grew with a coming storm. &#8220;Oh, haste,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried; &#8220;seek refuge ere this dreary waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reeks with the rain!&#8221; And fast they sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to his ocean-cave. There safe, o&#8217;erhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They watched the piling clouds. With angry roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The baffled billows broke upon the rocks. O&#8217;er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them rushed the shrieking storm. Wild through the grot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandered the prisoned wind, a troubled ghost that sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repose. Or low did moan, and trembling, wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some sore-hearted thing that hideth, pale,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span><span class="i0">And dare not front the day; and wilder still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In chords melodious, swelled or sank, until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sighed, &#8220;Oh, this weird harp among the caves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange players hath! For loud as one that raves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rises. Now more sweetly fade away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its mellow notes than thy thin pipes.&#8221; &#8220;One day,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, &#8220;mayhap my strain may please, when wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth not outpipe my slighted reeds. Unkind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art.&#8221; &#8220;The storm is past; to mine own land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would return,&#8221; she said.  And Eblis o&#8217;er the strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led her. And homeward silent turned his prow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That swiftly through the swirling waves did plow.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But when they parted, Eblis mused, &#8220;I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No gift soever winneth her, rich though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It be and seemly. Into this pure soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through fear of ill, I enter; or by goal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of future gain before it set.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">So came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He to her pleasance yet again. A flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaped high above a brazier that he bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its sweet, white, scented wood quick lapping o&#8217;er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With darkened face Eblis above her hung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;This hath, than my poor pipe, a keener tongue,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smileless and stern, he said. &#8220;Oh, dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">List how the wild, crisp, crackling ruby flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eats through the tender boughs. A trusty knave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is, that serves me well, and loud doth rave<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span><span class="i0">As tiger caged. When I do set it free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With angry fangs leaps on its prey. But see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It now sleeps harmlessly, till Eblis calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His faithful servant back. Lilith, when falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The red fire at thy feet, dost fear?&#8221; &#8220;Nay, nay,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cried, and drew her white neck up.  &#8220;A way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tame it thou hast found. Believe me, since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is thy slave I too will bind it, prince.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should Lilith fear? Unfaltering, these eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have watched when rushing storm-clouds heaped the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the black whirlwind, with loud, deafening roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat the torn waves; or whirled against the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tumbling billows, with fierce lips that bit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shrinking land. And the wreathed lightnings split<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloud with thunder dread: or wildly burst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the sea the water-spout. Shall first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She fear thy flame, who feared not these?&#8221; &#8220;Fit mate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou for Eblis,&#8221; answered he. &#8220;His fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Share, great-souled one. Thou wouldst not meanly shrink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though his strong heart did fail. O Lilith, think!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crown of clustered worlds thou mayest find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou with him who loveth thee wilt bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy life.&#8221; &#8220;Nay, far happier seems to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than eagle caged, the wild lark soaring free,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span><span class="i0">She said. And through her rose-pleached alleys strayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They to the sea. And tender music made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That guileful voice; yet slow his wooing sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those summer days. But when were dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brown the crisping leaves, &#8220;Oh, love,&#8221; he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Of all the centuries, thou rarest bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy shut heart open wide. Its sweet perfume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I should die, fain would I parting drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleeps yet thy love? From me no longer shrink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Lilith. Oh, lift up thy tender eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their blue depths doth happy morning rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis night if they be closed.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">She softly sighed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ancient strife recalling, thus replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;When dwelt a prince discrowned, well satisfied?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fallen, loving, still art thou a prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And otherwhiles might sorrow bring me, since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might hap thou wouldst much desire her realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were Lilith thine; for princes seize the helm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Love lies moored, and bid the shallop seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the waves new lands. But Love is weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, alas, the craft upon the sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dashed, while one, on-looking, wrings her hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such days I have outlived. Like Adam, thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance will seek to bind the loosed. Then how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(If one hath drunken wine of liberty)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall she, athirst, rejoice; no longer free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be glad?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><span class="i1">&#8220;My love,&#8221; he said, &#8220;large-hearted lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full dowers thee, and royal bounty gives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor knoweth law, save Lilith&#8217;s wish alone.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;on the polished stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fronts yon hill, write, Eblis, in full day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other time we read it clear, and say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;Hereon are graven all those early vows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We whispered low aneath the summer boughs,&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Write every word. That so the stone shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever a witness mute twixt thee and me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall I know thou seekest in me no thrall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For after-days, if thou make compact. All<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast said, write now.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Then on the stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she had said, graved Eblis, and thereon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did set his seal. So wedded they: and hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hand the wide world roamed. Or in her land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abode. And oft, of hours, ere yet on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He walked, she questioned.  Or he loosed with mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her yellow hair, down-streaming o&#8217;er his arm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &#8217;gainst his cheek her breath came sweet and warm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As through his dusky locks caressing played<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fingers slim; and shadows, half afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw in his wild eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Or paths remote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They trod, watching the white clouds rise and float<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span><span class="i0">Athwart the sky. Or by the listless main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or &#8217;neath the lotus bough, slow paced the twain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dragon-trees spread their cool leafy screen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faint crept odors through the mangroves green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where paused the pair upon the sandy shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love-tranced, unheeded, swiftly passed them o&#8217;er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad summer days: till one hour softly laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Lilith&#8217;s feet a fair, lone babe, that strayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From distant Dreamland far. So might one deem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That looked upon its face. Or, it might seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From other climes, a rose-leaf blown apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down-fluttered there, to gladden Lilith&#8217;s heart.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>o</span> that fair Elf-child other summers came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Lilith walked, heart-hungered, filled with shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naught comforted. And in that shadow-land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sorrowing bore, in after-time, a band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of elfin babes, that waked dim echoes long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgotten there, and ghastly bursts of song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Lilith saddened more, for that she knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curse was fallen now. And cried she through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast-falling tears, &#8220;Oh, me most desolate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shall not know in any time the fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of happier mothers! Nay, nor cool touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of baby hands. Oh, longed-for, loved so much!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, my babes, ere yet hour-old ye fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out-spreading shining wings with jeering cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afar from me. Most hapless I, from whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crown of motherhood, yet white with bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls blighted! Close in these empty arms fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I clasp my babes! My tender pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But once could ye not solace? Nay, &#8217;tis vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall not kiss their lips, nor hear again,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span><span class="i0">As gladder mothers may, low-rippling, sweet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh, soulless ones, can ye not wait awhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Till on your loveless lips I wake one smile?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But merrily out-laughed the phantom crew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On shining pinions white, swift seaward flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or upward rose, slow-fading in the blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lured her trembling, green morasses through.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &#8217;mong the frothy waves they vanished fast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or shrieked with glee borne on the wintry blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wilder raised their warlock song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While fairer grew each day that elfin throng.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To pluck the mangoes brown, fair Lilith sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One morn. Quick throbbed her heart. On mossy bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay all her babes. With face like morning, shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One there, and wide her yellow hair out-blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As &#8217;twere in play. Red-flushed her cheeks, and deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her lips the baby smiles. Asleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was one, white-gleaming, pure as pearl unseen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sunless caves, close-shut. And one did lean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against his fellow, lithe, sun-flushed and brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rings of jetty hair that low adown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bosom streamed. And one there was, whose dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#8217;erflowed with laughter. And one did seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-waking. One, with dimpled arms in sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust elbow-deep in moss, that sure did weep<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span><span class="i0">Ere yet he slept, and on his cheek scarce dried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wilful tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Then low, pale Lilith cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As near she drew, down-bending tender eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;And are ye here, my babes; and will ye rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I but break your sleep?&#8221; His naked feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One faintly moved as low she leant; and warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His slumbrous breath stirred &#8217;gainst her circling arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slow aneath his closed lids slipped a waft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wind, that loosed a trickling tear. Its craft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother-heart forgot thereat. &#8220;At last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to my breast, my babes,&#8221; she cried, and fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughing, outstretched her eager hands and strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lay with empty arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">The elfin throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breasted the pulsing air with mocking song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Alas,&#8221; she said, &#8220;could ye not give one kiss&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One tender clasp of hands! And must I miss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your throbbing hearts from my cold, barren breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye soulless ones, that flout my lonely rest?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">There, prostrate, long lay Lilith, and there, late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Mid dew-fall, Eblis found his stricken mate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;O Eblis, say o&#8217;er me what curse hangs bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now no more,&#8221; she said, &#8220;this realm seems fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its fruits grow bitter, all its light falls chill.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From Lilith&#8217;s famished heart its wildest pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, my Eblis, it were wise to seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surcease of grief. That Lilith, is so weak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wedded thee; and that she sinned, knew not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if we part, mayhap may follow naught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of other ills.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">&#8220;Sweet love,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;o&#8217;er-late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art so timorous. At Eden&#8217;s gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so, what time the angel barred her way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Lilith stood. Shelter within my arms. Oh, say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not our young love sweet? Hath it grown cold?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me thou sharest endless life; nor old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shrivelled, shalt thou be. And not one trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of earth&#8217;s decay (sure doom of thy sad race)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall taint thy babes. For lo, I give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy soulless ones immortal youth. They live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a pang. And yet, methinks the cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Earth adown the ages sounds, when die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its babes; and mothers bend dumb lips above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fold still hands, that answer not their love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilith, doth not indeed my love outweigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caresses missed from phantom babes? Astray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Eden long, here in this fair domain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And inland mountains. Mirk the jungle&#8217;s glooms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair thy fertile plains. Oh, sweet the glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we together watch the day, that low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the winds lies still. Shut lilies blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While here we wait. Come, for they fain would show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their golden hearts. Or, love, with me to float<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it not sweet, through flowery bays remote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past coves and peaks? Or pierce yon ocean&#8217;s verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through wild tumbling waves our sails to urge?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Yea, sweet is love,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and sweet to roam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By listless currents lulled; or &#8217;mid the foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low dip our feathery oars,&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;yet sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is still the mother-heart that hears no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lisping tongues. And sad, when baby smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have left it desolate. And baby wiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall cheer it never more.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">&#8220;Yet,&#8221; Eblis said,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The flickering marsh-fires swift they light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And children follow their false tapers bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the spongy bogs. The ship-lad smiles,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><span class="i0">Soft Lilith&#8217;s breathing &#8217;mong the droopt leaves stirred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, sore troubled, mused on every word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Lilith spake ere yet they slept. In all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreseeing much of ill that might befall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their love. &#8220;O, queenly soul! Of finer grain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art than angels are. And more in brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than man, I hold thee. Sooth, yet taints thee still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One touch of womankind. And since so chill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She finds her babes, must I forego my vow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one flaw, Hope&#8217;s clear crystal break? Oh, how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ally her cause with mine! So doth she long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For human love&mdash;a baby hand is strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hurl my empire down. From her soft heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red, baby lips can drain revenge, and start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbidden tears. And pity wakes to life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When &#8217;mong dead embers she sits lone, and strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is done.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&#8220;Then, at Regret&#8217;s dull heels, lo, fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retrieving follows. Happy days long past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She will recall. If so for love she yearn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to her early home once more will turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pardoning her wilful lord. And he again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall win the woman I so love, and fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would hold forever. Lilith, thou one balm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my lost soul in all this world! Shall calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sufferings, or love me, any one, save thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou in Adam&#8217;s arms forgettest me?<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><span class="i0">My only love! Nay, then, &#8217;twere surely wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shut these baby faces from her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New seeds of wrath to sow, her hate so feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all her rankling wounds afresh shall bleed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her ears &#8216;Good Adam!&#8217; will I cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest she forget Eden she lost thereby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, &#8216;Adam!&#8217; I will laugh. Till her red lips with guile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#8217;erflow. And she shall curse him loud.  With subtlest wile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe won, then shall she ever be mine own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soul-bound to me in hate, more terrible than death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hate, that long outlasts Love&#8217;s puny breath&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O cunning craft, that with the self-same blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever wins my love, and smites my foe!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Last night, when Lilith slept, lest I might mar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her dreams, from our green couch I rose, and far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed silent. Know I not the spell that draws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My feet unwilling, Edenward. Its laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may not brave to rend my foe. Nor there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Angel pass, unseen. The night so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As prone among the glistening leaves I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Adam shone. Not sad, as on a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erstwhile he seemed. And I could almost swear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of silvery laughter on the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell soft. And a fleet footfall &#8217;mong the flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattered the dew. Yet &#8217;mid those silent bowers<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span><span class="i0">Naught else I saw or heard save rippling flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waters, and the moonshine white. Oh, low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak, Eblis, lest aloud the night may tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy secret to the stars. Yet it were well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If lies the hidden cure for Lilith&#8217;s woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close shut in Paradise.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">&#8220;All would we know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we, close hid without those verdant walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together watched. What fate soe&#8217;er befalls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I care not, if with me she bide.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Down bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He o&#8217;er her hair, thick with the night-dew sprent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft kissed it, crying, &#8220;Love, the morn shines bright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waken, my Lilith, now. Through lands of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our happy course afar doth ever wend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past smiling shores where mighty rivers bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past cove and cape and isle, and winding bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still blue mists, that hang athwart the day.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat she rose, and joyously they sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By broad lagoons where musky odors shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New blooms. About them coiled long wreaths of vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slim lianas drooped, and marish lichens fine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fared they on o&#8217;er many a slanting beach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mountain crest; past many an open reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forest wild&mdash;till over Paradise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They saw the stars, clear, tender, loving, rise.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span><span class="i0">Then &#8217;neath the screen of those rose-girdled walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hid without, listing the waterfalls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or bird belated, twittering to its nest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So still the spot, the very grass to rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed hushed.<br /></span>
<span class="i7">The garden-close, a clinging rose o&#8217;ercrept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its lustrous stem without that drooping swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick set with buds as tintless as the snows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On sunless hills, when wild the north wind blows.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lilith a-tiptoe stood; upreaching, caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swaying boughs. Her eyes with longing fraught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close scanned her old deserted home. Then came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her spirit sadness, as if blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unuttered breathed through those remembered glades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And touched the odors moist &#8217;mong mirky shades.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wistful gaze, she traced each bosky dell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each winding path. And sweet youth&#8217;s memories fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Then was she ware of Adam, slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pacing the pleasance-ways. With ruddy glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh shone his cheeks, and crisp his hair out-blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By wanton winds. His lips were mirthful grown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once he made pause hard by the coppice green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hid the watcher. Once the leafy screen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So near he passed, from the overhanging edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He brushed a rose. The hindering hedge<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span><span class="i0">Quick through, in sudden blessing slim white hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fain had she reached. &#8220;O Eden mine! Dear land,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sighed. And springing warm the tender tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of teardrops gemmed the roses at her side.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So greets the weary wanderer once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His early home. The lintels worn, the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Age-stained; the iris clumps, in sheltered nook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mill-wheel rotting o&#8217;er the shrunken brook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunny orchard, sloping west; and far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cold, above his mother&#8217;s grave, a star&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then quick unbidden tears, the heart&#8217;s warm rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#8217;erflow his soul, and leave it pure again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Lilith backward turned to holier days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching through misty tears where trod those ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her feet in other times.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Sudden and sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came down those paths a glimpse of flying feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sound of girlish laughter smote the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In jealous rage, Lilith uprose to dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guarding Angel&#8217;s wrath. But, silver clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mocking laugh of Eblis caught her ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Thou hast forgot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this peaceful land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Living, thou canst not enter.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">But her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grasped once again the roses&#8217; shining strand,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span><span class="i0">And &#8217;neath her guileful touch, like scarlet flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snowy flowers burned. So, first Earth&#8217;s shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around them set the spik&egrave;d thorns.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Long there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale Lilith looked, as coldly still and fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As carven stone. Then, with a fierce despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sense of utter loss, downbending there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fingers hot she tore the hedge apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid thereto her face. With sorer smart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gazed again. For now, the twain at rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were laid. Pure as a dream, Eve&#8217;s sinless breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A babe close pressed. One pink foot, small and warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the leaves was hid. One dimpled arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aneath her head.<br /></span>
<span class="i7">Low Eblis sneered. &#8220;I wot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In young Eve&#8217;s arms my Lilith is forgot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, soon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;these earth-worms changeful turn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the oped rose when red the shut buds burn.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wild eyes on the babe she fixed. &#8220;Oh, blind,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cried, &#8220;was I. Yea, if the wanton wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth mock, I will not chide. Was it for this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wandered far, and bartered Eden&#8217;s bliss?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this have lost the very bloom of life?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Adam comfort finds, not knowing strife!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look you, that fragile thing at Adam&#8217;s side&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heed her not. But Lilith is denied<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span><span class="i0">The treasure she so careless doth possess.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See how the babe, scarce waking, doth caress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother! Look! Oh, hear the mother croon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above her child! Ah, Eblis, love, I swoon&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall not know such joy. Alas, to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No babe shall come! Accurs&eacute;d may she be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cursed Adam too. Thrice heavy on the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this poor babe my wrong be visited.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, trembling, she brake off.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">&#8220;Fast fades the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet love. Once more to our dark realm of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us return,&#8221; he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">As on fared they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With merry jest, Eblis gan cheer the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nay, otherwhiles mirth pleased,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Knowest thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What name she bears, who dwells in Eden now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Lilith went, long tarried Adam lone?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said. Replied he, &#8220;All to me is known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since that same hour you parted. What befell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee as we wend onward I will tell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Calm morn in Eden streaked the skies with red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flushed the waiting hills above the grassy bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Adam, joyless, saw new rise the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwinding golden webs night-vapors spun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart low meads. Slow, droning murmurs sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waking bees, with bloom and fragrance blent.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><span class="i0">Unheeded poured her music blithesome Day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reedy brooks beside and shallows gray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lone to Adam seemed the place, and cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The landscape dumb, as one aneath the mould.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Lilith&#8217;s sake, no more was Eden fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bloomless the days, the nights bowed down with care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft pacing pathways dim, he saw the gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of strange-faced flowers beside the purling stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or toyed with circling leaves; or plucked the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watched through rifted trees the clouds o&#8217;erpass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide roaming, heard the waters idly break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far &#8217;gainst the curving beach.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">&#8220;And grieving, spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;Oh, sweet with thee each hour&mdash;each wilding way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet the memory of each gathered spray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could you not wait, dear love? Or come once more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, &#8217;till you come, vain doth great Nature pour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her richest gifts.&#8217; He paused, and heard alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respondent fall, the wood-dove&#8217;s plaintive moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spent winds among the scented glades.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moss-couched beneath the glinting forest shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gazed, when shadows o&#8217;er the hills crept light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick vanishing, like phantom fingers white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until on mead, and mere, and sounding shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eden found voice, sad plaining, &#8216;Never-more!&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long time he pondered on blue peaks remote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When slow, as stranded ships that listless float,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span><span class="i0">Moved by the sunset clouds. Or the white rack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept o&#8217;er the garden walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">&#8220;&#8216;Would I their track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might take,&#8217; he said, &#8216;Lilith, so long you stay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom my soul follows sorrowing&mdash;alway.&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus ever mourned he, comfortless; that so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In after days the Master, in the glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of morning-tide, the mother of the race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave for his solacement.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">&#8220;Oh, fair the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Eve bent o&#8217;er his sleep. Ere down the glade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The startled fawn leaps swift, her glance dismayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Questions the hunter, mute. Such eyes&mdash;so brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So soft, so winning, shy&mdash;that looked adown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Adam waked. Like vagrant tendrils, tossed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark hair about her brows. And quaintly crossed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hands upon her breast. Less red the dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That deepest cleaves the folded rose&#8217;s heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than her round cheeks. Not hers the regal air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lilith lost, the white arms, lissom, bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slender throat; the elbows dimpled deep, whereto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might scarcely reach Eve&#8217;s head.<br /></span>
<span class="i13">&#8220;Yet soft, as through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some pleasant dream, the summer&#8217;s spicy air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirs odorous &#8217;mong seaward gardens fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In southland hid; so, gently, Eve straightway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Adam&#8217;s life unbidden came, to stay<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span><span class="i0">Forever there. Sure entrance then made she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into that heart untenanted by thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&#8220;So, to some olden house, from whose shut doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One went erewhile, another comes. Its floors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All empty sees. The lowly threshold worn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moss-grown roof, the casements left forlorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the shadows round about him stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Missing the footsteps passed to other lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whispers tenderly, &#8216;Since here no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The owner bides, what harm if on the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pass? Good chance it were the clambering vine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the porch with fingers deft to twine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To draw the curtains, ope the door. For who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May know how soon these paths untended, through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He comes again, with weary, way-worn feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who made aforetime, other days so sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, I enter now. For whose dear sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These vacant rooms, white, fragrant, clean, I make.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when, world-wearied, he returns, we twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance together bide. Nor part again.&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Eve found refuge. Tender love, the spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby she ruled. Peaceful the pair did dwell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast fled the happy years, till softly laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her glad arms the babe&mdash;a winsome maid.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ended there. Between them silence deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell, as they journeyed. And the furthest steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They crossed, that o&#8217;er their shadow-world rose high.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then saw they level plains, their home, anigh.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span><span class="i0">And now, seeking her pleasance once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They came to their own land. But all in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His care. Silent she was, and oft did grieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Eblis wrathful cried: &#8220;Because this Eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adam holds dear, art mourning? Still dost yearn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mate his sordid soul? Or wouldst thou turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From summer land to Eden walls?<br /></span>
<span class="i14">&#8220;The man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belike, ne&#8217;er loved thee. So is it young Eve can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pulses sway. Is she not passing fair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fancies wild, it is her daily care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bend beneath his ever fickle will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red-lipped and soft, she deftly rules him still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he wist not. Yet sweeter Lilith&#8217;s frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than archest smile she wears. Great Soul! The crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou bearest of fadeless life. For fleeting dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Paradise, beside the winding streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou resign such boon? Thou art, in sooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mold too firm for Adam&#8217;s love. In truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prince&mdash;though fallen&mdash;consorts best with thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say which were wise, with Eden&#8217;s lord to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, shining high, the purer soul, the star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fadeless burns, and Eblis lights afar?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it not grand through endless spaces hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me to drive, above a shrinking world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our chariot, wide?<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span><span class="i8">&#8220;For I foresee when dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark days upon our foes, and hope is gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, my Lilith, now, as seems thee good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make choice.&#8221; Thereat she, turning where she stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With kisses hung about his neck, and smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying, &#8220;Thine, Eblis, thine!&#8221; So were they reconciled.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>nd</span> Lilith oft to Paradise returned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fierce within her, bitter hatred burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And better, dearer, seemed revenge than aught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She else desired. The coppice oft she sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much hoping direful evil might be wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the love that bloomed in Eden.<br /></span>
<span class="i15">Wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft strayed fair Eve; the little maid, beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plucking the lotus; or by sedgy moats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From ribbed papyrus broad, frail fairy boats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deft fashioning. Or Adam, watching, smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flowery wreaths engarlanding the child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughed the pair, intent on pleasant toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When blithe the child upheaped her fruity spoil&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great globes of red and gold. Or roguish face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#8217;er feathery broods, or in the further space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To count the small blue eggs, she sportive bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far her restless feet swift glancing went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It chanced one day she watched the careless flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of vagrant butterflies, that circled light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncertain, high, above a copse rose-wreathed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then soft down-dropping, gaudy wings they sheathed<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><span class="i0">Beside a darkling pool. The copse anear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With yellow buds was strewn. And softly here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She crept, deeming her little half-shut hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might snare the fairest of that gleaming band.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ere she touched it, wide its wings outspread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In flight.&nbsp;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">And still she, swift pursuing, sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the groves, till wearied, slept the maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the mid-day shadows, lowly laid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Without, stooped Lilith. And with fingers swift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the leaves she oped a small green rift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she might see the child. The hedge was wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With starry blooms. Whereto her hand she set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she awaked, seeing each dainty frond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fragrant ferns, dusk mirrored in the pond.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child came near the copse, much wondering:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From glossy stems the smooth leaves sundering.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stooping o&#8217;er the rift, she saw there, low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the hedge, a face like drifted snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft eyes, blue as violets show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the brooks; and hair that downward rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the ground in glittering strands of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mute stood the maid, naught fearing, but amazed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then nearer drew, and lingering, she gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those blue orbs. And smiling as she knelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger quickly loosed her shining belt<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span><span class="i0">Of gems. Flawless each stone whose pallid gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit silent nooks, or slept by far-off stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheeded&mdash;pale pearls with shimmering light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From distant oceans plucked, blue sapphires bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And diamonds rosy-cold, and burning red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rubies fine, and yellow topaz shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its sultry glow, jasper, dull onyx white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sardonyx, rare chalc&egrave;don, streaked with light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against her white breast that bright zone she laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stretched it, flashing forth, toward the maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clasped it round her throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i13">A luring strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sung, sweet as the pause of summer rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So soft, so pure her voice, the child it drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still nearer that green rift; and low there-through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She laughing stroked the down-bent golden head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her soft baby hands. And parting, spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silken hair about her little face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed the temptress through the green-leaved space.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat fell Lilith snatched the babe and fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying, as swift from Eden&#8217;s bounds she sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like a fallen star shone on her breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child, &#8220;At last! at last! thy peaceful rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long will cease. O helpless mourn, frail Eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncomforted. O hapless mother, grieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Lilith far from thee thy babe doth bear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She leaves thy loving arms, thy tender care.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><span class="i0">Nor canst thou follow anywhere my flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When far we go athwart the falling night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, little babe, close-meshed in yellow hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou liest pale! Fear not, thou art so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much comfort lives in thee.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">So ended she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And onward, hostile lands among, passed fleet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue solitudes afar, till paused her feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where highest &#8217;mong hoar climbing peaks, uprose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mountain crest.<br /></span>
<span class="i7">It was the third day&#8217;s close.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those untrodden ways there was no sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sight of living thing, the barren heights around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hum of insect life, no whirring wing of bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare rocks alone, all fissured, blotched and blurred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with red stain of battle-fields unseen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far, far below, still vales were shining green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaping downward swift, a mountain stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crept soft to sleep, where meadow grasses dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wan, wayworn, there, the babe upon her knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilith sat down. &#8220;O Eve,&#8221; she said, &#8220;on me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child smiles sweet! Fondle her silken hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If now thou canst, or clasp her small hands fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast my Paradise. Lo, thine I bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afar from thee. See, then! Its transient woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy babe e&#8217;en now forgets; and sweet and low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It babbles on my knee. In sooth, not long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endure her griefs, and through my crooning song<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><span class="i0">She kisses me, recalling not the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence she has come. Nay, nor her mother&#8217;s face.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long time stayed Lilith in that land. More calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each day she grew, for soft, like healing balm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child&#8217;s pure love fell on her sin-sick soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now oft among the crags, fleet-footed, stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid, or lightly crossed the fertile plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blithesome sang among the growing grain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That brake in billowy waves about her feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the wheat full ripened was, and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She plucked and ate. Thereat a shadowy pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sense of sorrow, stirred that childish brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wist not why. For it did surely seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before her waking thought, with pallid gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of other days, dim pictures passed; of wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stream, beyond these mountain rims. And stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed, midway a garden wide, a tree that bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like silver gleamed, and broad boughs light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uplifted. Like ripened wheat the fruit thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When low the westering sun upon it shone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then slow the maid did turn, and silent stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Lilith&#8217;s side. And o&#8217;er that mountain land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down-looking, mused. Or lifted pensive eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaze that questioned if in any wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She might perceive the land she longing sought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of its stream, or garden, saw she naught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat Lilith with white lips drew more near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clasped in her lithe arms the child so dear.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span><span class="i0">And once again fled swift, a shadowy shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across green fields.  And heard, through silence, break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice she could not hush, that loudly wailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;My babe! Give me my babe!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And Lilith paled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listening, heard, borne ever on the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tread of feet fast following behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then westward turned, where once among new ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Eblis she had trod in other days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When far they wandered. Thitherward she bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her timid steps, the babe upon her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until with travel worn her noontide rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took. And now a land of alien blooms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About them lay, outwafting strange perfumes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quaint defiles, that sloped behind a bay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And level fields; and curly vines that lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick clustered o&#8217;er with unripe fruit; and bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above them fragrant limes and spicy scent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of citron and of myrtle all the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made sweet, and &#8217;mid the trees, an open space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Not far away a broad lagoon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned like a topaz &#8217;neath a crescent moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For day was parting. Even-tide apace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew on, and chill the night dews filled the place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the waters dusky shadows clung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ashen-gray the broad leaves drooping hung;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span><span class="i0">Low &#8217;mong the marish buds lay one that made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the sudden dusk a duskier shade&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despairing arms upflinging to the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiting the silence with unheeded cry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;O mother, childless! Wife&mdash;of all bereft!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, my babe, not even thou art left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To comfort me, in these last hopeless days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut out from Paradise. Through unknown ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought thee sorrowing. Oh, once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Adam, come! Is not this gnawing pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of punishment enow, that thou unkind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art grown? Ah, never more shall I thee find?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, I ever was but weak. Alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot live. Come but again, mine own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer leave me mourning, desolate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In tears I call thee. Oh, in tears I wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sweet, forgiving kiss!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Ended she so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her plaint. And &#8217;mong the glistening leaves hid low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilith yet fiercer clasped the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that lorn mother, tear-stained, weeping, wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured forth her woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i9">As one that wakes to life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From peaceful dreams, leaps quick amid the strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of morning hours, so now the maid to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Lilith&#8217;s arms strove hard. And loosed her clasp,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span><span class="i0">And turned her shadowed face with plaintive moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fond beseeching eyes, where lay her mother lone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Lilith hardening, seized the child again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from her ears shut out the mother&#8217;s pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wilful hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">So passed she quick away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the dusky path, low fallen, lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale Eve, till clear she saw the dawn&#8217;s pure ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she looked, the voice of one she heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anigh. Her heart to sudden joy was stirred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Rise up, mine own,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no more apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We walk.&#8221; Then she arose, and cried, &#8220;Dear heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close hold me. So! Methinks I dreamed we were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parted long time.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">So went, the exiled pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From home thrust out, together&mdash;everywhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft they journeyed on with sufferings spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To distant lands. And oft with labor bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recalled the olden home, with brimming eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hemmed in by mountains blue&mdash;lost Paradise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meanwhile, to her own realm Lilith long since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was come, glad greeting Eblis. &#8220;O my prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have most bravely done. Our foes full sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are smitten now. My guerdon o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wilt bestow, I ween, in kisses warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As my own southland&#8217;s breath. For I great harm<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><span class="i0">Have wrought that hated pair. With feeble moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies Eve in a far land, thrust out. Alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserted. And whence angered Adam flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not. Nay, nor what new world his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold. Nor even if he live.<br /></span>
<span class="i11">&#8220;But see!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleeps on my breast the babe&mdash;Eve&#8217;s babe. And she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall know no more its tender, sweet caress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft medicining woe. The wilderness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncheered by love, is hers.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">And by the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peaceful abode, long time content, the three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save that the child unmurmuring drooped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then oft above her Lilith, singing, stooped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striving to wake the baby smiles again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her wee, warm mouth. Vain wiles! And vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her loving skill. All still she lay, and pale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one at sea pines for a lonely vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besprent with cuckoo flowers; the faint wild breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cradled buds, among the cloven elms, and saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;I shall not see that place beyond the seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any more pluck red anemones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In windless nooks.&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">So seemed the child, and frail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one that weeps above dead joys. Then pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew Lilith as those wasting lips she pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed the filmy eyes, and kissing, blessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><span class="i5">But Eblis touched the hand so worn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faded, wasted face. &#8220;Happy, thou mother lorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseeing her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This fragile thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day lies on thy breast. To-morrow&#8217;s wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath brushed it from thy sight.&#8221; Low Lilith sighed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;My Eblis, is this death?&#8221; And louder cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;But thou art wise, and sure some hidden way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this sore hap canst find. O Eblis, say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou no spell whereby the child may live?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O love, my realm thy recompense I give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she be healed.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i7">&#8220;Nay; not Archangel&#8217;s craft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stays fleeting life, or turns Death&#8217;s nimble shaft,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said. &#8220;Yet if,&#8221; she mused, &#8220;I laid again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child in young Eve&#8217;s arms, like summer rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother&#8217;s love may yet restore again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This shriveled life. And yet, must I resign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The babe? Alas, my little one! Nay, mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more!&#8221; Weeping she ceased.<br /></span>
<span class="i13">But after, bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child far northward; the exiled pair o&#8217;er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many lands long seeking. Till from a crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of barren hills Lilith looked down. At rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The twain she saw, for it was eventide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And low they spoke of hidden snares beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their unknown path, since unaware fared they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into this hostile spot. The dim wolds lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All bare beneath chill stars. And far away<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><span class="i0">Were belts of pine, and dingy ocean shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like wrinkled lip. Cold was the land, and hoar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wintry rime.  Near by, its leafless boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thorn bush bent, with withered berries red.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sight thereof Adam, rejoicing, said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;My Eve, bide here. From yonder friendly tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ripe fruit I will pluck and bring to thee.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, leave me not! This solitude I fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land about is chill,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and drear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems to me.&#8221; But Adam answered, &#8220;Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sore famished art thou, and not far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is&mdash;nor long I stay.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i9">So parted he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not long alone was Eve. Upstarted she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismayed. A woman, most exceeding fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside her stood, with coils of yellow hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blue eyes, calm as sleep among the hills&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim lakes. Eve, frighted, shrank. As mountain rills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet fell the stranger&#8217;s words. &#8220;My sister, one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is here that glad salutes thee. And since done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is now my quest, and here my journey ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bring a goodly gift. For elsewhere wends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My pathway, Eve.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">&#8220;Beside a coppice green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brighter than gold, purer than silver sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a fair garden, once a jewel shone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With it, compared in all the world, no stone.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span><span class="i0">And low the Master set it shining clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the hedge, saying, &#8216;When she draws near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She will perceive on whom I do bestow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This moteless gem, that fellow doth not know.&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&#8220;Now I without the copse that day was hid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft shone the jewel, as the moon amid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue. And in the garden I saw thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in the midst stood a fair wheaten tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As emerald green. Its ears, as rubies red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fragrant as breath of musk, its odors spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white its shining grains as rifted snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked again. And in thy fair hand, lo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full ripe bright gleamed the yellow wheaten grain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou saidst, &#8216;Though I did eat, I live.  No pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath marred this pleasant feast.&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i13">&#8220;Then I the more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desired thy gem. &#8216;All things most goodly pour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Eve their gifts. But I am famished lone,&#8217;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rayed like a frozen tear the pure Night shed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The which with trembling hand I seized, and fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afar.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A dream. A voice called loud, &#8216;Straightway restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Eve that which is hers; lest I, that bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set it against the hedge, will quench its light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, I will crumble it and quickly smite<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><span class="i0">It into dust e&#8217;en from thy hand.&#8217; Mine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I careless closed. But yesternight &#8216;Arise!&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stern voice cried. &#8216;Stay not at all. For lo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wait not. Lest I scourge thee sorely, go!&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, Eve, though long upon my heart I wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This jewel rare, behold, I now restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine own!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then Eve cried loud, &#8220;Ere my heart break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me my babe!  Where is she, for whose sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sorrowed all these years&mdash;the little maid?&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, through tender sobs.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And Lilith laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apart upon her breast her garment, dyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blended hues. And stooping at Eve&#8217;s side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave back the child.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Among green hills&mdash;and enters glad therein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Lilith was.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">So passed she once again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into her land.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But Eve, like rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long pent, upon the child poured swiftly down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet kisses. And again, twixt laugh and frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divided, smoothed the baby face, and through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fingers soft the silken hair she drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed again.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span><span class="i8">And with a vague surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recalled the stranger&#8217;s smile, the mournful eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much marveling whence she fared. And said, &#8220;As pale<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">So you deem her,&#8221; he replied. And mused on all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eve told.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And watching, saw a shadow fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the child. And later, did recall<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She lies! Ah, little one, unseal those eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rouse but awhile, ere waning daylight flies!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she discerned not yet its doom, nor knew<br /></span>

<span class="i8">But Adam, parting, drew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all the lone hours through Eve, babbling, smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown. And blew her warm breath o&#8217;er the cheeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So wan. &#8220;The night grows cold,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Sleep creeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull on my babe. The night grows cold and chill,&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor dreamed aneath those lids closed still,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">A wind uprose, and swept<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The child. Cold grew the night and colder, till<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the east the dawn glowed daffodil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above dun wolds white with new-fallen snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rose the day and widened into morning glow<br /></span>

<span class="i9">Still lay the child, nor stirred.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And strove to wake the maid. In vain. Her task<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was done. And as she gazed, a gentle grasp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft loosed the dead from that cold mother&#8217;s clasp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lilith laid the babe in its chill bed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightened the limbs, and kissed the little head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o&#8217;er the sleeper, kneeling, she did lean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from her breast she drew, close folded, green,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Therefore, one pardoning kiss give e&#8217;er I go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my own land, beyond this realm of snow.&#8221;<br /></span>

great capacity to amuse and instruct our growing youth can take a wider

which so many books of the present day lack.&mdash;<i>The Times, Canada.</i></p>

<p>Margaret Sidney may be safely set down as one of the best writers of
juvenile literature in the country.&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>Margaret Sidney&#8217;s books are happily described as &#8220;strong and pure
from cover to cover,... bright and piquant as the mountain breezes, or
a dash on pony back of a June morning.&#8221; The same writer speaks of her
as &#8220;An American authoress who will hold her own in the competitive
good work executed by the many bright writing women of to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are few better story writers than Margaret Sidney.&mdash;<i>Herald
and Presbyter.</i></p>


<p class="center"><b>Comments of the Secular and Religious Press</b>.</p>


<h3 style="text-align: left">FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS AND HOW THEY GREW.</h3>

<p>A charming work.... The home scenes in which these little Peppers
are engaged are capitally described.... Will find prominent place
among the higher class of juvenile presentation books.&mdash;<i>Religious Herald.</i></p>

<p>One of the best told tales given to the children for some time ...
The perfect reproduction of child-life in its minutest phases, catches one&#8217;s
attention at once.&mdash;<i>Christian Advocate.</i></p>

<p>A good book to place in the hands of every boy or girl.&mdash;Chicago
<i>Inter-Ocean.</i></p>


<h3 style="text-align: left">SO AS BY FIRE.</h3>

<p>Will be hailed with eager delight, and found well worth reading.&mdash;<i>Christian
Observer.</i></p>

<p>An admirable Sunday-school book&mdash;<i>Arkansas Evangel.</i></p>

<p>We have followed with intense interest the story of David Folsom ...
A man poor, friendless, and addicted to drink;... the influence
of little Cricket;... the faithful care of aunt Phebe; all steps by
which he climbed to higher manhood.&mdash;<i>Woman at Work.</i></p>


<h3 style="text-align: left">THE PETTIBONE NAME.</h3>

<p>It is one of the finest pieces of American fiction that has been published
for some time.&mdash;<i>Newsdealers&#8217; Bulletin</i>, New York.</p>

<p>It ought to attract wide attention from the simplicity of its style, and
the vigor and originality of its treatment.&mdash;<i>Chicago Herald.</i></p>

<p>This is a capital story illustrating New England life.&mdash;<i>Inter-Ocean</i>,
Chicago.</p>

<p>The characters of the story seem all to be studies from life.&mdash;<i>Boston
Post.</i></p>

<p>It is a New England tale, and its characters are true to the original
type, and show careful study and no little skill in portraiture.&mdash;<i>Christian
at Work</i>, New York.</p>

<p>To be commended to readers for excellent delineations, sparkling style,
bright incident and genuine interest.&mdash;<i>The Watchman.</i></p>

<p>A capital story; bright with excellent sketches of character. Conveys
good moral and spiritual lessons ... In short, the book is in every
way well done.&mdash;<i>Illustrated Christian Weekly.</i></p>


<h3 style="text-align: left">HALF YEAR AT BRONCKTON.</h3>

<p>A live boy writes: &#8220;This is about the best book that ever was written
or ever can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This bright and earnest story ought to go into the hands of every boy
who is old enough to be subjected to the temptations of school life.&#8221;</p>

Series.</h2>


<p>The preparation of this famous series was a happy inspiration. No books
for the young worthy of circulation have ever met so warm a welcome or
had a wider sale. The fact that each of them has passed the criticism of
a committee of clergymen of different denominations, men of high scholarship,
excellent literary taste, wide observation, and rare good judgment,
is a commendation in itself sufficient to secure for these books the widest
welcome. The fact that they are found, in every instance, to be fully
worthy of such high commendation, accounts for their continued and increasing
popularity.</p>
